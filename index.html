            <strong>Pancakes </strong>are a type of flat cake made from a batter of flour, eggs, milk, and sometimes other ingredients, such as baking powder, salt, or sugar. They are cooked on a hot surface, such as a griddle or frying pan, and can be served plain or with a variety of toppings, such as syrup, fruit, or whipped cream.

            <strong>Braised lamb</strong> shanks are a classic dish that is slow-cooked in a flavorful sauce until the meat is fall-apart tender. The shanks are typically browned in a pan before being braised in a mixture of wine, stock, vegetables, and herbs. The long cooking time allows the flavors to meld together and the meat to become incredibly tender. Braised lamb shanks can be served with mashed potatoes, rice, or crusty bread
